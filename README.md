<a name="WhatIsThis"/><br>
#### What does this plugin do?<br>
This plugin is designed to take one of the more annoying aspects of RPG Maker and give you an easy way to handle it.  I am speaking about game lore.<br><br>

Game lore is one of those things most RPG Maker devs run screaming from because of the very bad ways in which it has to be implemented.  RPG Maker, for many years, has not
had an easy way to display information to the player leaving many to use events that only impart information to the player at the time of their interaction with the event (for
example, a bookshelf).  Another way is by using images created in an image editor that have information on them that are then displayed to the player.  These are likewise hard to maintain.

The last option is a plugin.  Like this one.  Through out the various versions of RPG Maker there have been dozens of plugins that track in-game information be it lore or just general information about found items, seen enemies, and the like.  This plugin intends to be a one-stop-shop; containing not only a lore codex, but also various "books" that will allow your players to see various information on enemies, weapons, items, and more.<br><br><br>
